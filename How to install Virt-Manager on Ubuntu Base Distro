Let's install required packages:

sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager

To Start and Enable Libvrt run these commands:

sudo adduser yourusername libvirt

sudo adduser yourusername kvm

sudo systemctl start libvirtd

sudo systemctl enable libvirtd

sudo systemctl status libvirtd

Open this file and uncomment these 2 Lines below by removing pound sign in front of line:

sudo nano /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf

uncomment 

unix_sock_group = 'libvirt'

unix_sock_rw_perms = '0770'

You need to add your user name to qemu and uncomment to the linue user= and group= so run this in terminal:

sudo nano /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf

# Some examples of valid values are:
#
#       user = "qemu"   # A user named "qemu"
#       user = "+0"     # Super user (uid=0)
#       user = "100"    # A user named "100" or a user with uid=100
#
user = "your user name"

# The group for QEMU processes run by the system instance. It can be
# specified in a similar way to user.
group = "your user name"

If you start virtual machine and guest OS as no internet connection run this command and uncomment firewall_backend line and change nftables to iptables and save file:

sudo nano /etc/libvirt/network.conf   

firewall_backend = "iptables"   

Restart libvirt:

sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
